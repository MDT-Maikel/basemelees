Golden Skies

You are part of an expedition which fights over the fortunes available in the golden skies. You start with a small and relatively secure base from which you can explore and start mining. Eliminate your opponents and claim the golden treasure. 

Goal: Destroy all enemy flagpoles.

Hints:
- Materials and weapons can be bought at the flagpole.
- All the gold is at the top of the map, mine fast though safely.
