[Folder Information]
This folder contains a consistent set of base melees for the original OpenClonk contents.

All rounds have roughly the same features, an attack-free start up phase which allows the
players to construct their settlements and defenses. There will be provided a menu which 
allows the placement of certain structures by the team leader.


[Information for Developers]

* Use misc/tools/create-release.sh to generate the packed scenario folder.
* Test a few games from the packed scenario folder for script errors.
* Release this new version to Lorry and other platforms.
* Create a release branch for future bugfixes (git branch v1).

[Versioning]
The version is only stored in the Version.txt file. This file is read by the release
scripts to determine the version and append it to the folder name. The scheme for the
verion is X.Y where X indicates a major release and Y a bugfix release. Bugfix releases
are developed on the branch of the release by commits cherry-picked from master. The
version can have an indication in brackets appended, like (Alpha), (Beta) or (RC) which
indicates that this version is not final.


[List of Open Todos]
* Improve the fancy logging
* Improve the medal menu (sorting & grouping)
* Improve the medal menu (update on changed medal count and removed player)

	* Also fix the Ejection() mess by Ringwall.
