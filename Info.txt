[Folder Information]
This folder contains a consistent set of base melees for the original OpenClonk contents.

All rounds have roughly the same features, an attack-free start up phase which allows the
players to construct their settlements and defenses. There will be provided a menu which 
allows the placement of certain structures by the team leader.
