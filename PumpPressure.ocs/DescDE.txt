Pumpendruck

Entrapped in a small area teams have to prevent their base from being flooded. The pumped liquids end up in the areas of the opposing teams, so the fastest pumping teams will prevail. You can also attack your opponents directly via the passages above and underground.

Ziel: Vernichte alle Flaggen der Gegner.

Tipps:
- Either go for the direct attack or defend and flood the base of your enemies.
- There are gems at the bottom of the map which provide large amounts of clunkers.
- In the caves deep down there is infinite supply of resources to sustain battles.
- Connect any pump to the base drain at the top of the map to pump liquids to the enemy.
