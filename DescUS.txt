Base Melees

This scenario folder contains melees focused around settlement and strategy. Base melees are longer rounds where teams fight each other from their bases. Gameplay is focused around building up the base, defending the base and attacking opponents. A team wins if all other teams are not controlling a base anymore, which is marked with flags. Each of the rounds in this folder offers a wide variety of strategic and creative tactics depending on its landscape. Some specific additions to improve base melees have been made and they are described one by one:

- Medals are awarded for original or courageous actions, the player gains some wealth which can be spent on warfare. Get aware of what medals you can aim for to gain an advantage over your enemies.

- Sometimes a landscape allows for immediate attacks between enemy teams, in this case attack barriers can allow for small amount of time to prepare a defense. Feel free to configure the attack barriers using the dedicated scenario option.

- There is a special scoreboard which contains all kinds of information which can be useful during play, most notably the amount of flags and opposing team has can be found here. Press Tab during a round to open the scoreboard.
